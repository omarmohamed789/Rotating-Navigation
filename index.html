        <h1>Cats Like People! (Some People, Anyway)</h1>
        <small>By Rachel Nuwer</small>
        <pre>
          In the perennial battle over dogs and cats, there’s a clear public
          relations winner. Dogs are man’s best friend. They’re sociable,
          faithful and obedient. Our relationship with cats, on the other hand,
          is often described as more transactional. Aloof, mysterious and
          independent, cats are with us only because we feed them. Or maybe not.
          On Monday, researchers reported that cats are just as strongly bonded
          to us as dogs or infants, vindicating cat lovers across the land. “I
          get that a lot — ‘Well, I knew that, I know that cats like to interact
          with me,’” said Kristyn Vitale, an animal behavior scientist at Oregon
          State University and lead author of the new study, published in
          Current Biology. “But in science, you don’t know that until you test
          it.”

          Owning a cat can bring unconditional love and companionship to your
          life. Having a feline friend can also bring health benefits, helping
          to relieve stress and improve your heart health.
